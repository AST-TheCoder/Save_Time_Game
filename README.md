This is the game of searching the shortest route from source to destination.

Rules of the game:
You are given a NxN grid. Now you are at top-left cell. You have to go from top-left to bottom-right cell.
Each cell takes a time written on it. You have to minimize total time.
You will be given 5 minutes. You have to define the path by L, R, U & D.
  L -> Go left from the current cell.
  R -> Go right from the current cell.
  U -> Go up from the current cell.
  D -> Go down from the current cell.
Suppose, your answer is "RDDRUL". That means you will go Right, Down, Down, Right, Up & Left.
If you cross the border or can't reach to the destination, you will lose.
